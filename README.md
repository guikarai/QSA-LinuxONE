# Quantum-Safe Assessment for Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE environments

## 1	Overview
* Today’s digital trust depends heavily on encryption, making it essential to ensure encryption mechanisms are secure and adhere to appropriate standards.
* Future quantum computers pose potential risks, including the ability to rapidly break encryption algorithms and access sensitive data. Therefore, developing a quantum-safe strategy for critical business systems is a prudent step.
* This assessment aims to evaluate encryption quality and provide recommendations to enhance IBM Z encryption both for today and the future.
* This document serves as a guideline for customers to collect the necessary data to ensure the successful delivery of the Quantum-Safe Assessment for Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE environments only (Not z/OS).

## 2	Introduction
* To be able to analyze the hardware crypto utilization of Linux on IBM Z or LinuxONE, we need to gather operational data (logs, traces, dumps…  records for all systems that is part of the agreed scope (Number of LPARs).
* This operational data collection allows us to analyze your Linux guest’s crypto activities, performance, and configuration to propose optimizations and recommendations.
* We need the following operational data collection:
  -	Infrastructure cryptographic services
  -	API cryptographic services
  -	Key management services
  -	Network encryption services
  -	Data at rest encryption services
  -	Application encryption services

See detailed guidelines in operational data collection chapters.
