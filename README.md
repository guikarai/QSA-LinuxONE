# QSA-LinuxONE
## 1	Overview about Encryption Assessment
Todayâ€™s digital trust depends heavily on encryption, making it essential to ensure encryption mechanisms are secure and adhere to appropriate standards.  
Future quantum computers pose potential risks, including the ability to rapidly break encryption algorithms and access sensitive data. Therefore, developing a quantum-safe strategy for critical business systems is a prudent step.  
This assessment aims to evaluate encryption quality and provide recommendations to enhance IBM Z encryption both for today and the future.  
This document serves as a guideline for customers to collect the necessary data to ensure the successful delivery of the Quantum-Safe Assessment for Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE environments only (Not z/OS).
