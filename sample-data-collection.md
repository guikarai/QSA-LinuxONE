# One time configuration dumps
This section is about collecting at first for each Linux Guest, information about their configuration, and existing packages. This will allow IBM TEL expert to plan better next phase of the Quantum-Safe assessment.

Results of a list of Linux commands to be redirected into a unique file per Linux Guest.

panel.exe --ks-list --ks-type=CMB --kba-type=PKA >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

List the coprocessors currently active in the LinuxÂ® system and their master key status.
```
panel.exe --status
```

**5. Evaluate JAVA configuration**

Verify the installed Java version to ensure JCE is available.
```
java -version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

If your Java application uses SSL/TLS, validate its configuration with the following command.
```
java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl -version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Display the installed security providers and their configuration.
```
java -Djava.security.debug=provider -version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

**6. Evaluate OpenCryptoki configuration**

Display slot info.
```
pkcsconf -s >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Display the list of available tokens by using the command.
```
pkcsconf -S >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Show the accumulated statistics from all users. Only the root user can display the accumulated statistics from other users.
```
pkcsstats -A >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Show the statistics from all users. Only the root user can display statistics from all users.
```
pkcsstats -t >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

**7. Evaluate zKey configuration**

To display the version number of zkey.
```
zkey --version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

To list all secure keys in the secure key repository and display their attributes.
```
zkey list >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

**8. Evaluate OpenPGP configuration**
To assess OpenPGP (GPG) configuration, certificates, and key materials on a Linux system, you can use the following commands.

Verify the installed GPG version to ensure it supports modern algorithms.
```
gpg --version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

To display all keys public in your GPG keyring.
```
gpg --list-keys >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

To display all keys private in your GPG keyring.
```
gpg --list-secret-keys >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Inspect the trust model and trust levels assigned to keys.
```
gpg --check-trustdb >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Inspect the GPG configuration file for custom settings.
```
cat ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

To check the supported algorithms for encryption, signing, and compression.
```
gpg --version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

**9. Evaluate Libica configuration**

Use the icainfo command to check on the CPACF feature code enablement. The icainfo command displays which CPACF functions are supported by the implementation inside the libica library. Issue the following command to show which cryptographic algorithms will be hardware-accelerated by the libica driver, and which one will remain software-only implementations.
```
icainfo --version >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

```
icainfo >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Validate that the libica crypto API is working properly. Please issue the following command:
```
icastats >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

**10. Evaluate dmcrypt configuration**

To list all active dm-crypt mappings.
```
dmsetup status >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Alternate way to list all active dm-crypt mappings.
```
lsblk >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

Inspect the system logs for dm-crypt related errors.
```
sudo dmesg | grep dm-crypt >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
```

To evaluate the encryption algorithm and cipher being used:
```
sudo dmsetup table >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"

```
openssl engine -c >> "$(hostname)_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt"
